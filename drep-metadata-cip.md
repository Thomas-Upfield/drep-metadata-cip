## Abstract
The Conway ledger era ushers in on-chain governance for Cardano via [CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md), with the addition of many new on-chain governance artefacts. Some of these artefacts support the linking off-chain metadata, as a way to provide context.

The [CIP-100 | Governance Metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0100) standard provides a base framework for how all off-chain governance metadata should be formed and handled. But this is intentionally limited in scope, so that it can be expanded upon by more specific subsequent CIPs.

This proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to CIP-100 for DRep registration, updates and retirement. Without a sufficiently detailed standard for DRep metadata we introduce the possibility to undermine the ability of DReps to explain their motivations and therefore people looking for someone to represent them with the best possible information available to make that choice. Furthermore a lack of such standards risks preventing interoperability between tools, to the detriment of user experiences.


## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?
Blockchains are poor choices to act as content databases. This is why governance metadata anchors were chosen to provide a way to attach long form metadata content to on-chain events. By only supplying an On-Chain hash of the off-chain we ensure correctness of data whilst minimising the amount of data posted to the chain.

### For people wishing to delegate their voting power
When observing from the chain level, tooling can only see the content and history of DRep registration, update and retirement certificates and any associated anchors. These on-chain components do not give any context to the motivation of a DRep. Although this information would likely be the desired context for people who might delegate their voting power. By providing rich contextual metadata we enable people choosing a DRep to delegate their voting power to, to make well informed decisions.

### For all participants
By standardising off-chain metadata formats we facilitate interoperability for tooling which creates and/or renders metadata attached to DRep registration, update and retirement transactions. This in turn promotes a rich user experience between tooling. This is good for all governance participants.

## Specification
CIP-1694 specifies that metadata anchors are optional for DRep registration, updates and retirement transactions. This CIP covers metadata for the aforementioned transaction types, but it does not cover metadata for voting transactions. 

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?
<!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and what led to particular design decisions. It should describe alternate designs considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss significant objections or concerns raised during the discussion.

It must also explain how the proposal affects the backward compatibility of existing solutions when applicable. If the proposal responds to a CPS, the 'Rationale' section should explain how it addresses the CPS, and answer any questions that the CPS poses for potential solutions.
