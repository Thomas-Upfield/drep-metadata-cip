## Abstract
The Conway ledger era ushers in on-chain governance for Cardano via [CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md), with the addition of many new on-chain governance artefacts. Some of these artefacts support the linking off-chain metadata, as a way to provide context.

The [CIP-100 | Governance Metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0100) standard provides a base framework for how all off-chain governance metadata should be formed and handled. But this is intentionally limited in scope, so that it can be expanded upon by more specific subsequent CIPs.

This proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to CIP-100 for DRep registration, updates and retirement. Without a sufficiently detailed standard for DRep metadata we introduce the possibility to undermine the ability of DReps to explain their motivations and therefore people looking for someone to represent them with the best possible information available to make that choice. Furthermore a lack of such standards risks preventing interoperability between tools, to the detriment of user experiences.


## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?
<!-- A clear explanation that introduces the reason for a proposal, its use cases and stakeholders. If the CIP changes an established design then it must outline design issues that motivate a rework. For complex proposals, authors must write a Cardano Problem Statement (CPS) as defined in CIP-9999 and link to it as the `Motivation`. -->

## Specification
<!-- The technical specification should describe the proposed improvement in sufficient technical detail. In particular, it should provide enough information that an implementation can be performed solely on the basis of the design in the CIP. This is necessary to facilitate multiple, interoperable implementations. This must include how the CIP should be versioned, if not covered under an optional Versioning main heading. If a proposal defines structure of on-chain data it must include a CDDL schema in its specification.-->

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?
<!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and what led to particular design decisions. It should describe alternate designs considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss significant objections or concerns raised during the discussion.

It must also explain how the proposal affects the backward compatibility of existing solutions when applicable. If the proposal responds to a CPS, the 'Rationale' section should explain how it addresses the CPS, and answer any questions that the CPS poses for potential solutions.
